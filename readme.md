For the parallel function, a code was written to calculate the total resistance of 2 or more resistors in parallel. The function was able to accept a list of numbers of any length.
For the potential divider function, a code was written to calculate the voltage drop across some number of resistors connected in series. The function was able to accpet a list of numbers of any length.
For the temperature check function, a code was written to determine the condition of a patient based on their temperature reading in degrees celsius or farenheit. The conditions include: hypothermic, hyperthermic and normal. 
These codes were written to complete the lab assignment. It was also written to build on python coding skills.
